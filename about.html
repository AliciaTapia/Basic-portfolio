			<h2> About Me </h2>

			<img src="/Users/Alis/Documents/BootCamp/Basic-portfolio/assets/images/alicia.jpg" alt="Awesome" width="25%">

			<p> I was born and rised in Monterrey Nuevo Leon, a very nice city in Mexico. I went to school there and graduated of Food engineering I love to create new thing expeimenting with flavors, colors and textures. Love to learn something new every day. I am not good with small talk but once I feel confident cant stop talking :P </p>

			<p> Love to dance and do yoga as well as traveling. Of course I love food all presentations thats part of the reason I keep going to the gym not because I like to excersise but because I love to eat. I dont have a specific kind of music I love but like to listen to everything depending how i feel at the time.</p>

			<P> Moved a year ago to Houston and I like everything but the traffic.</P>
